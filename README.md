# d breakup

This simulation is made to find the cross section that GEANT4 uses to calculate the breakup of deuterium into protons and neutrons by incident 14.03 MeV neutrons commonly produced by nuclear fusion.

The goal of the simulation is to change the neutron deuteron breakup at 14.03 to a new experimental DDX.
